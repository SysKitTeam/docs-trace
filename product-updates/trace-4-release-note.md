**Product version:** 4.0.0  
**Build number:** 1113  
**Release date:** Mar 16, 2021

## Support for Microsoft Intune 

We have added initial support for Microsoft Intune. SysKit Trace will now report on all the iOS Intune policies. In future releases, we hope to add Android and Windows policies as well.

## Support for Azure Active Directory Conditional Access Policies

SysKit Trace now reports on Azure Active Directory Conditional Access Policies. We believe this is the best step to expand the number of reports on Azure Active Directory. You will also find another set of reports ready for you in the Azure Active Directory part of the application. If there are reports that you would like to see in the future, you can use our feedback portal to let us know!

## Improvements and fixes

* Exchange Online resources are now collected using application identity.
* Fixed issues with tenants without Skype for Business (development tenants)
* Fixed issues preventing usage of SysKit Trace when conditional access and multi-factor authentication was set up.
