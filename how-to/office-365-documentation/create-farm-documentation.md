# Create Farm Documentation

This section describes how you can generate Office 365 tenant settings documentation using SysKit Trace.

1. Navigate to the **Home Screen** and click the **View Snapshots** button to view all of your snapshots. Double click the snapshot to open it and navigate to the [Office 365 Explorer](../../get-to-know-syskit-trace/office-365-explorer.md). If you navigate to the Office 365 Explorer without opening a snapshot the newest snapshot will be opened automatically.
2. Click **Generate** button in the ribbon on the top part of the screen. You can select the format in which you wish to create your farm documentation by clicking on the dropdown. The available formats are **.docx, .pdf and .xlsx**.
3. The Office 365 tenant settings you want to export can be selected form the tree.

   The selection you make can be saved and used as a template for generating documentation in the future. SysKit Trace comes with predefined documentation templates, with commonly used options already pre-selected.

   The documentation templates available by default are: **All, Regular Documentation .** Use the Up and Down arrows to rearrange the order of your documentation.

4. The **Document Outline** tab displays how the table of contents of your document will look.
5. Click the **Generate** button, wait a few moments and your Office 365 tenant settings documentation will be generated!
