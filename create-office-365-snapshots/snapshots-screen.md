The following commands are available:

* **Open** – open currently selected snapshot.
* **Delete**– this button will delete the currently selected snapshot from previously defined snapshot locations.

* **Export**– use this button to create tenant snapshot file which can be transferred to any other location. 
* **Show Changes** – shows differences between the currently selected snapshot and an older snapshot \(if one exists\).
* **Compare Wizard**– starts Compare Wizard for more complex comparisons.
* **Compare to Local** – compares a snapshot with the currently loaded local tenant.
* **Compare Selected** – if two snapshots are selected, this button compares SharePoint settings stored in these two.
* **Mark Configuration as Good** – use this button to mark which Trace snapshot captured your SOffice 365 tenant settings configured in a best possible way. 
* **Load Duration** - this column displays how long it took to take a snapshot of your environment.
