## What happens during product activation?

Product activation is a simple process that occurs during registration of the product. The license information is entered and then authenticated with the SysKit product activation server in order to activate the product. The entire activation process is quick and easy, and the majority of users will have to perform product activation only once.

## Who will be required to activate their products?

Anyone who downloads SysKit Trace will be required to activate the product. If the product is ordered online from the SysKit website, the product account information will be sent via email. If the product is downloaded from the SysKit website, you will be provided with a temporary license to evaluate the tool for a limited amount of time.

## How soon must I activate my product?

SysKit Trace will not work without a valid product key. When downloading the tool you will be provided with an evaluation license that is valid for a limited amount of time. This license, as the name suggests is for evaluation purposes only, and some limitations apply. Once the evaluation period is over you will need to acquire a proper license by buying the software. The default evaluation period is set to 14 days. In special circumstances SysKit can extend your evaluation period if a valid reason is provided. After the period expires, the application will stop working until it is activated with a new license.

## How do I activate my product?

You can activate your product 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the Internet. Product activation requires you to type in license key along with some additional information and press activate. You must have an active connection to the Internet in order to activate your product. More details can be found [here](activate-syskit-trace.md).

## What does SysKit do with the information sent during the product activation process?

We use the information only to verify that your product is used within the scope allowed by the SysKit End-User License Agreement \(EULA\). The information is stored in a database and used only for product activation data. If you register your product, none of the activation information will ever be linked to your personal customer information.

## What is product activation?

Product activation is an anonymous, secure and hassle-free process that authenticates licensed users during the installation process. The process verifies that the product account information indentified by the product key is genuine and has not been activated on more systems than allowed by the SysKit End-User License Agreement \(EULA\).

## Why does SysKit require their customers to activate the software?

Product activation is a simple way to reduce and deter unauthorized use and casual copying of SysKit products with a minimal effect on our loyal customers.

## Will the activation process ever send data to SysKit after I activate my product?

No. Activation is a secure and anonymous one-time process. After activation is complete, the license manager runs alongside the product for the sole purpose of verifying the integrity of the license file and the validity of the product license. The activation technology in the product does not send any additional information to SysKit.

## How long does the product activation take to complete?

Product activation is a one-time process that is typically completed immediately after installation of the software. Activation typically takes 2-5 seconds to complete.
