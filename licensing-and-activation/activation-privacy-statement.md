# Activation Privacy Statement

SysKit is asking you to activate your copy of SysKit Trace so we may verify if your product was obtained legally. During the activation process, your personal data will not be sent to SysKit.

Activation is based on a number of factors that are being calculated during the activation processes. The activation process identifies only the computer, but it does not include the information about your software or data that resides on your computer, or any other information about your computer model or environment.
