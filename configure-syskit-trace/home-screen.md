The Home Screen is a set of actions that can be used to quickly approach major SysKit Trace options.

The following options are available:

* **Compare Wizard** button starts the compare wizard that allows you to compare snapshots from different points in time or different tenants.
* **Options** button gives you access to configure options for SysKit Trace to your needs.
